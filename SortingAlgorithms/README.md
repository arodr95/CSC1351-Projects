Sorting Algorithms:

This project is intended to demonstrate the implementations of the Bubble Sort, Short Circuit Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Merge sort, and Quick Sort methods in Java. The main method outputs the amount of time, in miliseconds, each sorting algorithm takes to sort an array with a user defined amount of elements. The amount steps for Bubble Sort, Short Circuit Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, and Selection Sort are also output by the main method.   

Getting Started:

Use the source code from the sortingAlgorithms file on any java compiler.

Tests:

Input varying array sizes, when prompted, ranging from 100 - 1000000 to see compare the efficiencies of each sorting algorithm based on time and steps taken. 

Built With:

NetBeans IDE 8.1
